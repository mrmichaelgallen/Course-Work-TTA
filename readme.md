### Course Work

#### Objective
This is a repository of the various course drills and exercises that I have done during my education at The Tech Academy. It contains step by step work as well as things I solved on my own. 

If you would like to see my work where I solved coding challenges to get a better sense of my software developement skills, then please check out my [Portfolio](https://github.com/mrmichaelgallen/Portfolio-for-MichaelAllen) of my work.
