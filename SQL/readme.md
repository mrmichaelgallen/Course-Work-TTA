This is a collection of my course work, both following along drill work and some of my own solutions.

If you would like to see only my own solutions to software challenges, please check out my [portfolio](https://github.com/mrmichaelgallen/Portfolio-for-MichaelAllen) of my work with readme files detailing how I solved each one.
