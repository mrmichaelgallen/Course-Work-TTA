### Python - Sorting Numbers Drill
***

#### Objective

Write your own version of the sorted() method in Python. This method should take a list as an argument and return a list that is sorted in ascending order. Call your method passing in the following lists as arguments and print out each sorted list to the shell. This should be an algorithm that you write. Do not use .sort() or the sorted() methods in your method.

#### Steps Taken

Reviewed Python.org documentation and built. Had to go through multiple iterations of the software to get it to work.

#### Results

Got all drill to work. I gained a better understanding of the sequence needed when passing variables to other variables as well as looping to help sort. I also learned from my instructor that this method is not very efficient, because it will iterate through list multiple times. So if I had 1000 numbers, it would go through the x list a 1000 times reducing it by one each pass until all 1000 numbers were sorted into the sortDone list.
